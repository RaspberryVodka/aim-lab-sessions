It provides functions and data structures that allow fast, efficient manipulation of mathematical structures like matrices and vectors. It represents these structures internally using Numpy arrays, which are like Python Lists, but highly optimised for calculations on large amounts of numerical data. Let's import this module now."

    "One of the many things that set Numpy arrays apart from Python lists is their `reshape` method. This allows you to define the number of dimensions that the structure represented by the array has. For example, the array `np_from_list` that we have just defined is just a flat list of numbers at the moment. `reshape` helps us represent it as a 2D data structure (a matrix). Keep in mind that the shape that you put into this method must agree with the number of elements in the array. In our example, the array has 10 elements, so acceptable shapes include:\n",
