# Defining models
# The Sequential class is very simple: it accepts a sequence of neural network Modules as 
# arguments and arranges them such that the output of one is automatically sent to the input of the next in line. This saves
# us a bit of time writing some code, but has some drawbacks, as we shall see shortly.
# The following is the simplest possible neural network. It consists only of an input layer, 1 hidden layer 
# and an output layer

        nn.Flatten(),                # Input is a 2d array of pixel values, so we flatten it out to 1d
        nn.Linear(28*28, 128),       # Input layer connects each input node to each hidden node. MNIST images are 28*28 pixels, hidden size can be anything we want
        nn.ReLU(),                   # ReLU activation only lets a signal through if it is > 0
        nn.Linear(128, 10)  # Output connects each node in the hidden layer to 10 output classes - the number of digits we want to classify!
        
    )


# Now that we've defined a network, we can start training it! Let's define the simplest possible training loop, for 
# which we only require the model, number of training epochs, the dataloader and an optimisation function
