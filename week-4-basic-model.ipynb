    "The `Sequential` class is very simple: it accepts a sequence of neural network `Modules` as arguments and arranges them such that the output of one is automatically sent to the input of the next in line. This saves us a bit of time writing some code, but has some drawbacks, as we shall see shortly. The following is the simplest possible neural network. It consists only of an input layer, 1 hidden layer and an output layer. It is good practice to print out the summary of your network using `torchsummary.summary`. This lets you inspect your networks parameters and the input/output sizes of each layer. Interestingly, it also acts as a sort of sanity checker for your model, because it will complain if the input/output sizes of your layers aren't compatible with each other."

    "Something you may have noticed so far is that the training loop runs quite slowly. 5 epochs is not a very long time at all in the machine learning world and it still takes a while to complete. This because we've been asking the CPU to do all the tensor calculations needed to update the weights. This is a bad idea because GPUs are much more efficient at processing large amounts of data in parallel. You should always use a GPU to train machine learning models if one is available. Pytorch makes it very easy to detect GPU availability and transfer code you've written for a CPU to GPU:"
