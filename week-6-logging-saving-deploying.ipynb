    "## Subclassing nn.Module\n",
    "So far, we've looked at how to put together simple models using Pytorch's `nn.Sequential` function. Remember, all it does is sequentially line up the layers and directs the output of one into the input of the next. However, there are cases where we don't want out data to flow in such a linear fashion. A good example is a Residual Network or ResNet, which applies shortcuts between its layers. This cannot be done using a simple `nn.Sequential` construction. In such cases, it becomes necessary to sub-class the `nn.Module` class and create our own."

    "Model training on a typical machine learning project is a time-consuming process. Sometimes, we may even want to run the same model multiple times with different parameters to see which ones work the best (a process known as hyper-parameter tuning). If a model is allowed to run for a long time despite not getting any better at learning, that's wasted time and computing power. We use early stopping to tackle this problem. This is a simple algorithm that just says whether or not the model should be stopped, based on its performance over time. \n",

If such a thing were to happen in the middle of a training cyle, that could mean days or weeks of training lost in an instant.
